<h1>The <i>"Trias Politica"</i>:</h1>

**By Luca Borletti**

> According to the doctrine of separation of powers, 
> the U.S. Constitution distributed the power of the 
> federal government among the branches—legislative, 
> executive, and judicial—and built a system of checks 
> and balances to ensure that no one branch could 
> become too powerful.
